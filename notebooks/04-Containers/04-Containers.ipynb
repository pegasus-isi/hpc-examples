    "# Application Containers \n",
    "\n",
    "Application Containers such as Docker and Singularity are an attractive way to to package software with complex dependencies to be used during workflow execution. Use of containers ensures that your application code always sees the same runtime environment, when a job in your workflow runs on a remote worker node. It minimizes the chances of running into errors related to differing versions of dependant libraries installed on the worker nodes where the jobs of your workflow run. Additonally, use of containers promotes reproducibility as they provide a fully defined and reproducible environment in which your jobs run.\n",

    "This section of the tutorial will explain how you can specify a **Docker** container in Pegasus, to indicate the container in which the jobs of your workflow run.\n",

    "This notebook will generate the **diamond workflow** that we used in Exercise 1. Instead of executing the executables directly on the worker node, we will specify a **base container image** in which the executables defined in the Transformation Catalog should execute in. \n",
